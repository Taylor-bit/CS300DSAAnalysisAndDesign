# Reflections
The primary challenge that I addressed in this project was creating a program that could import, parse, and arrange course material using various data structures to facilitate quick and precise information retrieval. My method highlighted how crucial it is to choose the appropriate data structure for the task. After doing some runtime analysis and implementation, I discovered that a hash table provided the optimum speed and scalability for storing and retrieving course data based on course numbers. Initially, I tested with vectors and binary search trees. My understanding of how data organization impacts performance, particularly with huge datasets, has improved as a result of working with various structures.

I ran into and overcame obstacles like pointer management in tree operations and infinite loops brought on by incorrect logic order in linked list operations during the milestones. These exercises improved my debugging abilities and reaffirmed the importance of having a logical, unambiguous structure in my code. By focusing on maintainability and adaptability, this project helped me develop my approach to software design. I made sure to utilize sensible variable names, modular functions, and unambiguous error handling. I've also come to appreciate the importance of iterative development; frequent testing and minor adjustments helped identify problems early and maintain steady progress. All things considered, this project gave me greater confidence to create effective, legible programs and strengthened fundamental abilities that I can use to tackle increasingly challenging software engineering problems.
